1. automatic provisioning and deployment
    1. move credentials from vps to [docs/vaultwarden.md](docs/vaultwarden.md)
    2. github action on merge to main:
        1. pull credentials from vaultwarden
        2. provision vps (idempotent)
        3. deploy to vps (upload from within github action to vps)
        4. cd /opt/docker && docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
2. connect google drive <-> [docs/dolibarr.md](docs/dolibarr.md) <-> shopware if possible
3. [docs/shopware/TODO.md](docs/shopware/TODO.md)
4. maybe add nextcloud (docker-compose.yml)
5. [docs/minecraft.md](docs/minecraft.md)
    1. move modlist into a separate file to allow comments, then comment out disabled mods (currently disabled
       mods must be removed entirely, so there is no overview of them)
    2. auto-detect minecraft version from the mods in the modlist (the docker minecraft server in use already has
       this functionality, but it had a bug; that should be fixed by now)
